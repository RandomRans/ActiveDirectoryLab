<h1>Active Directory Lab</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab,I'm going to walk throguh how to walk through how to create an Active Directory home lab environment using Oracle Virtual Box.  Configuring and running this lab will definitely help develop your understanding of how active directory and windows networking works, so I'd highly recomment running through it a couple times, ask questions where stufff is unclear, and eventually try to build it on your own without watching. Please let me know if you have any questions.
